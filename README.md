Hi there I'm Ahmed Serag ðŸ‘‹

I've spent the last 12+ months and a couple thousand hours transforming my skillset at Lambda School in their Computer Science / Web Development program. I've had the opportunity to code everyday, create 10 projects weekly with Javascript / React / Python, attend lectures by and with experienced Computer Scientists daily, and collaborate with peers & co-students ranging from fellow developers to designers and data scientists.

If you're hiring Junior Developers, I would love the opportunity to interview and show you how I can use programming to build and maintain fantastic applications alongside your team. Send me a connection and message on my LinkedIn and we'll setup a discussion. Here's my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedcanam/


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an application for a large charity organization in the United States that will allow their employees to log services they're providing to those in need, as well as allow managers to vizualize the related data and make important decisions concerning resource allocation & production based on that data 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms via Python, as well as working on improving my CSS/design skills so that projects I build with React / Redux / Node / Express look nicer to the users using them and to myself as the creator
