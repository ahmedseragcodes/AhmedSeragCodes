Hi there I'm Ahmed Serag 👋

- 🎯 Working on engineering solutions to problems and fine tuning my skills in support engineering, web development, react/javascript, troubleshooting, root causing, bug reproduction and bug resolution 
- 🤖 I was blessed enough to begin learning to code in 2019 at a school formerly known as Lambda School and now known as BloomTech 
- 😁 I had a great, successful career in advertising and technology sales prior to learning how to develop, and really love being able to work on the whole customer journey now
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a dual American - Canadian Citizen and love both countries, so at anytime, I might be in either country and am authorized to work in both as a Citizen
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me a message on my LinkedIn and we'll setup a discussion. Here's my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedseragusa/
