Hi there I'm Ahmed Serag ðŸ‘‹

I've spent the last 12+ months and a couple thousand hours transforming my skillset at Lambda School in their Computer Science / Web Development program. I've had the opportunity to code everyday, contribute to apps and projects daily with Javascript / React / Python, attend lectures by and with experienced Computer Scientists daily, and collaborate with peers & co-students ranging from fellow developers to designers and data scientists.

Prior to this I spent most of my time generating sales and revenue for big and small companies via Facebook, Instagram, and Google advertising campaign management, optimization, and sales. I got a lot of experience deploying capital, strategizing customer journey's and targeting, analyzing data and optimizing campaigns based off generated insights, writing copy, and selling, and it was a great experience.
